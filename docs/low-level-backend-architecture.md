# Low-Level Backend Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the low-level backends in the Prism framework, including the Assembly and C/C++ backends for high-performance computing.

## Overview

The Prism framework provides multiple levels of abstractions for hardware-specific optimizations:

1. **High-Level Device Abstractions**: Hardware-specific devices (Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton, etc.)
2. **Low-Level Computational Backends**: Assembly and C/C++ backends for optimized numerical operations
3. **Backend Registry**: Centralized registration and discovery system for backend selection

This tiered approach enables both ease of use and maximum performance by allowing the framework to choose the most optimal implementation based on the specific operation, hardware capabilities, and user preferences.

## Components

### 1. Backend Registry

The `BackendRegistry` serves as the central hub for backend registration, discovery, and selection. It provides methods to:

- Register backends with their capabilities
- Find backends based on operation type
- Find backends optimized for specific architectures
- Provide discovery and introspection capabilities

Key interfaces:
```python
def register_backend(name, backend_class, capabilities)
def get_backend(name)
def find_backends_for_operation(operation)
def find_backends_for_arch(arch)
```

### 2. Assembly Backend

The Assembly backend generates, assembles, and executes optimized assembly code for ARM and x86_64 architectures with specialized SIMD instructions.

#### Components:

**Code Generation**:
- `ARMAssemblyGenerator`: Generates ARM assembly with NEON/SVE optimizations
- `X86AssemblyGenerator`: Generates x86_64 assembly with SSE/AVX/AVX-512 optimizations

**Assembly**:
- `Assembler`: Interfaces with system assemblers (GNU Assembler, LLVM assembler)
- `ARMAssembler`: ARM-specific assembler interface
- `X86Assembler`: x86_64-specific assembler interface

**Runtime**:
- `AssemblyKernel`: Loads and executes compiled assembly code
- `AssemblyBackend`: High-level interface for the entire backend

### 3. C/C++ Backend

The C/C++ backend generates, compiles, and executes optimized C/C++ code with architecture-specific optimizations through compiler intrinsics and flags.

#### Components:

**Code Generation**:
- `CCodeGenerator`: Generates architecture-specific C/C++ code
- Templates for common operations (vector addition, matrix multiplication)

**Compilation**:
- `CompilerWrapper`: Interfaces with system compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC, Intel oneAPI, etc.)
- Architecture-specific optimization flags and compiler configurations

**Runtime**:
- `CompiledKernel`: Loads and executes compiled C/C++ code
- `CBackend`: High-level interface for the entire backend

### 4. Integration Layer

The integration layer connects the low-level backends with the core framework, making them accessible through a consistent API.

Key components:
- `LowLevelBackendRegistry`: Specialized registry for low-level computational backends
- Operation mapping system that connects high-level operations to backend implementations
- Backend selection logic based on operation type, hardware capabilities, and performance characteristics

## Backend Selection Logic

When an operation is executed, the framework selects the most appropriate backend based on:

1. **Operation Type**: Which backends support the operation
2. **Hardware Capabilities**: Available instruction sets (NEON, SVE, AVX, etc.)
3. **Performance Profile**: Expected performance characteristics for the specific workload
4. **User Preference**: Explicit backend selection through context managers

The selection logic follows this sequence:
1. If a specific backend is requested via context manager (`with prism.use_backend("assembly")`), use it
2. Look for backends that support the operation
3. Filter for backends optimized for the current architecture
4. Choose the backend with the best expected performance for the operation size and type

## Architecture-Specific Optimizations

### ARM Optimizations (Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton)

- **NEON**: 128-bit SIMD operations for vector processing
- **SVE/SVE2**: Scalable Vector Extensions for Graviton 3 and newer
- **AMX**: Apple Matrix extensions for Apple Silicon M-series
- **Neural Engine**: ML acceleration for Apple Silicon

### x86_64 Optimizations (Intel, AMD)

- **SSE**: 128-bit SIMD operations
- **AVX/AVX2**: 256-bit SIMD operations
- **AVX-512**: 512-bit SIMD operations for newer Intel CPUs
- **FMA**: Fused Multiply-Add operations for improved performance

## Compiler Support

The C/C++ backend supports multiple compilers with specialized optimizations:

- **GCC/Clang**: Standard compilers with good cross-platform support
- **Intel oneAPI**: Optimized for Intel architectures with advanced vectorization
- **AMD AOCC**: AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler for AMD CPUs
- **ARM Compiler**: Specialized for ARM architectures
- **MSVC**: Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Windows

## Data Flow

For typical numerical operations:

1. The user calls a high-level operation (e.g., `vector_add(a, b)`)
2. The framework identifies the optimal backend using the selection logic
3. The backend generates optimized code for the specific architecture
4. The code is compiled/assembled and executed
5. The result is returned to the user

## Performance Considerations

The framework implements several performance optimizations:

- **Code Caching**: Compiled/assembled code is cached to avoid redundant compilation
- **Memory Layout Optimization**: Ensures data is properly aligned for SIMD operations
- **Specialized Algorithms**: Uses different algorithms based on data size and hardware
- **Heterogeneous Execution**: Can split workloads across different backends based on their strengths

## Extension Points

The architecture is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **New Backends**: Additional backends can be registered with the framework
2. **New Operations**: Support for new operations can be added to existing backends
3. **New Architectures**: Support for new processor architectures can be added
4. **Custom Selection Logic**: The backend selection logic can be customized

## Future Directions

Planned enhancements to the backend architecture:

1. **GPU Backend**: Support for CUDA and OpenCL
2. **FPGA Backend**: Support for FPGA acceleration
3. **Distributed Execution**: Support for distributed computation across multiple devices
4. **Automatic Kernel Fusion**: Combining multiple operations into a single optimized kernel
5. **Dynamic Recompilation**: Recompiling code based on runtime performance measurements

## Conclusion

The low-level backend architecture in Prism provides a powerful foundation for high-performance computing across different processor architectures. By combining hardware-specific optimizations with a flexible backend system, it can achieve excellent performance while maintaining a clean, user-friendly API.
