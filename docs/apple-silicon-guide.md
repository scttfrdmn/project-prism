## Key Features

### 1. Neural Engine

Apple's Neural Engine is a dedicated processor optimized for machine learning workloads. The performance has improved significantly across generations:

- M1: 16-core Neural Engine (11 TOPS)
- M2: 16-core Neural Engine (15.8 TOPS)
- M3: 16-core Neural Engine (18 TOPS)
- M4: 16-core Neural Engine (38 TOPS)

Prism provides an API to leverage the Neural Engine for accelerating machine learning workloads. While the direct Neural Engine programming is handled through Apple's Core ML framework, Prism provides a consistent interface for device selection and utilization.

### 2. AMX Coprocessor

The Apple Matrix Coprocessor (AMX) provides specialized acceleration for matrix operations. Though largely undocumented, Prism detects AMX support and provides an API for applications to take advantage of the matrix coprocessor through the Accelerate framework.

### 3. Hardware-Accelerated Graphics

M3 and M4 chips feature advanced GPU capabilities:

- **Dynamic Caching**: Dynamically allocates local memory in hardware for optimal memory utilization
- **Hardware Ray Tracing**: Enables realistic lighting simulation for graphics workloads
- **Mesh Shading**: Provides advanced geometry processing capabilities

These features are detected by Prism and exposed through the device interface.

### 4. Unified Memory Architecture

Apple Silicon's unified memory architecture allows the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine to share the same memory pool without data copying. Prism takes advantage of this architecture for efficient memory management.

## Using Apple Silicon in Prism

### Basic Usage

```python
import prism as pr

# Use default device (automatically detects Apple Silicon on macOS)
device = pr.get_active_device()

# Create a specific device
m1_device = pr.backends.M1Device()

# Get device capabilities
capabilities = m1_device.get_capabilities()
print(f"Neural Engine: {capabilities['neural_engine_tops']} TOPS")
```

### Context Managers

Prism provides specialized context managers for each Apple Silicon variant:

```python
import prism as pr

# Using generic Apple Silicon context manager
with pr.apple_silicon(version="M1Pro") as device:
    # Code executed with M1 Pro active
    result = my_computation(data)

# Using specific context managers (recommended)
with pr.m3() as device:
    # Code executed with M3 device active
    if device.supports_ray_tracing():
        # Use ray tracing capabilities
        result = ray_trace_compute(data)
    else:
        result = standard_compute(data)

# Using M4 with Neural Engine acceleration
with pr.m4() as device:
    # Optimize function for Neural Engine (illustrative)
    optimized_fn = device.optimize_for_neural_engine(
        my_neural_network_function,
        precision="fp16"
    )
    
    # Run optimized computation
    result = optimized_fn(input_data)
```

### Device Variants

For professional workloads requiring more cores and memory bandwidth:

```python
import prism as pr

# Using M1 Ultra for maximum performance
with pr.m1_ultra() as device:
    # Code executed with M1 Ultra device active
    # 2x memory bandwidth of M1 Max
    result = my_hpc_computation(data)

# Using M3 Max for GPU-intensive workloads
with pr.m3_max() as device:
    # Utilize enhanced GPU capabilities
    if device.supports_ray_tracing():
        result = render_complex_scene(scene_data)
```

### Workload Optimizations

```python
import prism as pr
import numpy as np

# Allocate and use memory efficiently
with pr.m4_pro() as device:
    # Get optimal alignment for this device
    alignment = device.get_optimal_memory_alignment()
    print(f"Using {alignment}-byte alignment for optimal performance")
    
    # Create aligned arrays for computation
    size = 1024 * 1024
    a = np.zeros(size, dtype=np.float32)
    b = np.zeros(size, dtype=np.float32)
    
    # No need for explicit data transfer due to unified memory
    compute_result = my_compute_function(a, b)
```

### Automatic Device Selection

Prism can automatically select the optimal device for your workload:

```python
import prism as pr

# For inference workloads, prefers M4 for newer Neural Engine
inference_device = pr.create_optimal_device(
    workload_type="inference",
    batch_size=32,
    precision="fp16"
)

# For ray tracing workloads, automatically selects M3+ chips
ray_tracing_device = pr.create_optimal_device(
    workload_type="custom_logic",
    ray_tracing=True
)

# HPC workloads prefer M1/M2 Ultra or M3/M4 Max/Ultra variants
hpc_device = pr.create_optimal_device(
    workload_type="hpc",
    memory_usage="high"
)
```

## Chip-Specific Optimizations

### M3/M4 Ray Tracing

```python
import prism as pr

with pr.m3() as device:
    if device.supports_ray_tracing():
        print("Hardware ray tracing acceleration available")
        
        # In a real implementation, would use Metal to leverage hardware ray tracing
        # Here's a simplified example of what the API might look like
        scene = create_scene()
        result = render_with_ray_tracing(scene, device)
```

### Neural Engine Acceleration

```python
import prism as pr

with pr.m4() as device:
    # Get Neural Engine capabilities
    neural_engine_tops = device.get_capabilities()["neural_engine_tops"]
    print(f"Neural Engine performance: {neural_engine_tops} TOPS")
    
    # In a real implementation, would use CoreML for Neural Engine
    # Here's a simplified example
    model = load_ml_model()
    optimized_model = optimize_for_neural_engine(model, device)
    result = run_model(optimized_model, input_data)
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Bandwidth**:
   - M1 Pro/Max/Ultra, M2 Pro/Max/Ultra, M3 Pro/Max/Ultra, and M4 Pro/Max have significantly higher memory bandwidth than base models
   - For memory-intensive workloads, prefer higher bandwidth variants

2. **Neural Engine**:
   - M4's Neural Engine (38 TOPS) offers more than double the performance of M3 (18 TOPS)
   - Use precision modes (FP16, FP8) appropriate for your workload to maximize throughput

3. **SVE Support**:
   - M4 is based on ARMv9 and supports Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) for enhanced matrix operations
   - M1/M2/M3 use NEON SIMD with 128-bit vector width

4. **Unified Memory**:
   - No need for explicit host-to-device memory transfers
   - Data remains in-place, significantly reducing overhead for GPU or Neural Engine computations

## Troubleshooting

### Detection Issues

If Prism fails to detect your Apple Silicon device correctly:

```python
import os

# Force specific device version
os.environ["APPLE_SILICON_VERSION"] = "M2Pro"

# Now create a device
import prism as pr
device = pr.get_active_device()
```

### Compatibility

If your workload requires a specific hardware feature:

```python
import prism as pr

# Check for hardware ray tracing support
device = pr.get_active_device()
if not device.supports_ray_tracing():
    print("Warning: This workload performs best with hardware ray tracing (M3/M4)")
    # Fall back to software ray tracing
```

## Example

```python
import prism as pr
import numpy as np

def main():
    # Get default device (automatically detects Apple Silicon on macOS)
    device = pr.get_active_device()
    
    # Print device information
    capabilities = device.get_capabilities()
    print(f"Device: {capabilities['name']}")
    print(f"Neural Engine: {capabilities.get('neural_engine_tops', 0)} TOPS")
    print(f"GPU Cores: {capabilities.get('gpu_cores', 0)}")
    
    # Benchmark using the specialized context managers
    with pr.m4_pro() as m4_device:
        # Create test arrays
        a = np.random.rand(10000, 10000).astype(np.float32)
        b = np.random.rand(10000, 10000).astype(np.float32)
        
        # Perform computation (no explicit data copying required)
        start_time = time.time()
        c = np.matmul(a, b)
        end_time = time.time()
        
        print(f"Matrix multiplication time: {(end_time - start_time) * 1000:.2f} ms")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
