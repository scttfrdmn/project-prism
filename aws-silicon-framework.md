**Analysis**: In environments with substantial workload variation, the AWS Silicon solution excels due to its ability to scale more elastically. The lower instance cost combined with more granular cloud scaling provides significant cost advantages while maintaining adequate peak capacity.

#### C.4.3 Population Genomics Project

A large-scale population genomics project processing 1000 samples per day consistently:

| Solution | Configuration | Total Instances | Cloud Reserved Instances Cost/Year | Effective Cost/Sample |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| NVIDIA H100 | AWS cloud deployment | 18 | $9.5M | $26.03 |
| NVIDIA A100 | AWS cloud deployment | 32 | $6.3M | $17.26 |
| AWS Silicon | AWS cloud deployment | 50 | $4.9M | $13.42 |

**Analysis**: At very large scales with consistent workloads, AWS Silicon maintains its cost advantage primarily through lower instance pricing despite requiring more instances to achieve comparable throughput. The RI discount structure for AWS Silicon instances also tends to be more favorable at scale.

### C.5 Practical Deployment Considerations

#### C.5.1 Multi-Workload Optimization

Real-world genomics operations typically run multiple types of analyses simultaneously. Optimal resource allocation across these workloads significantly impacts overall efficiency:

| Deployment Strategy | H100 Efficiency | A100 Efficiency | AWS Silicon Efficiency | 
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Single queue, homogeneous instances | 65% | 75% | 80% |
| Multiple specialized instance types | 75% | 82% | 92% |
| Dynamic workload balancing with auto-scaling | 82% | 85% | 95% |

**Analysis**: AWS Silicon's more granular scaling enables creating purpose-optimized compute clusters for different workload types (alignment-heavy, variant-calling-heavy, etc.), resulting in higher overall resource utilization in multi-workload environments.

#### C.5.2 Scaling with Evolving Requirements

Genomic analysis requirements evolve rapidly. The ability to adapt cloud resources to new requirements varies significantly:

| Adaptation Scenario | H100 Adaptation | A100 Adaptation | AWS Silicon Adaptation |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| New algorithm support | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Capacity expansion | Medium-High | Medium | Low |
| Workload mix change | Medium-High | Medium | Low |
| New analysis types | Medium | Medium | Low |

**Analysis**: The more modular nature of AWS Silicon deployments provides greater flexibility for adapting to changing requirements without wholesale instance type migrations, reducing the total lifecycle cost of genomic computing infrastructure.

#### C.5.3 Optimal Deployment Strategy

Based on the horizontal scaling analysis, the optimal deployment strategy varies by organization type:

| Clinical Diagnostic Lab | AWS Silicon for routine cases, H100 for time-critical cases |
| Research Institution | A100 for algorithm development, AWS Silicon for production |
| Population Genomics | AWS Silicon at scale with reserved instances |
| Startup | Begin with AWS Silicon for lower compute costs |
| Hybrid Cloud | Leverage cloud bursting with AWS Silicon for cost efficiency |

In almost all scenarios, a hybrid approach leveraging both technologies based on specific workload characteristics provides the most cost-effective solution.## Appendix C: Horizontal Scaling Analysis

### C.1 Horizontal Scaling Comparison

Horizontal scaling changes the cost-performance equation significantly. Here we analyze how throughput and cost efficiency scale when deploying multiple AWS Silicon systems to match or exceed the raw throughput of NVIDIA systems.

#### C.1.1 Matching NVIDIA H100 Throughput

| Solution | System Configuration | Samples/Day | Total Cost/Hour | Cost/Sample | Throughput Ratio | Cost Ratio |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| NVIDIA H100 | 1× p5.48xlarge | 57.1 | $98.35 | $41.31 | 1.0× | 1.0× |
| AWS Silicon | 3× (trn1.32xl + inf2.48xl) | 60.0 | $139.23 | $55.69 | 1.05× | 1.35× |
| NVIDIA A100 | 1× p4d.24xlarge | 32.0 | $32.77 | $24.58 | 0.56× | 0.59× |
| AWS Silicon | 1.5× (trn1.32xl + inf2.48xl) | 30.0 | $69.62 | $55.69 | 0.53× | 1.35× |

**Analysis**: When horizontally scaling AWS Silicon instances to match H100 throughput, the cost advantage disappears. It requires approximately 3 combined AWS Silicon instances to match one H100 instance's throughput, resulting in a 35% cost disadvantage. However, the AWS solution would offer more flexibility in job scheduling and failure resilience.

#### C.1.2 Cost-Optimized Horizontal Scaling

| Solution | Instances | Samples/Day | On-Demand Yearly Cost ($M) | Reserved 3-Year Cost ($M)* | Cost per Million Samples |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| NVIDIA H100 | 10 | 571 | $8.6 | $5.3 | $25,418 |
| NVIDIA A100 | 20 | 640 | $5.7 | $3.5 | $14,990 |
| AWS Silicon | 30 | 600 | $4.6 | $2.8 | $12,778 |

*Using AWS standard 3-year reserved instance pricing with all-upfront payment

**Analysis**: At scale, the picture changes. For high-volume genomics operations processing thousands of samples daily, AWS Silicon maintains a cost advantage in total cost despite requiring more instances to achieve comparable throughput. This is primarily due to lower instance pricing and better reserved instance discounting structures.

#### C.1.3 Scaling Characteristics

| Scaling Characteristic | NVIDIA H100 | NVIDIA A100 | AWS Silicon |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Min Scale Unit Cost | ~$98/hr | ~$33/hr | ~$46/hr |
| Throughput per Unit | 57.1 samples/day | 32.0 samples/day | 20.0 samples/day |
| Scaling Granularity | Large increments | Medium increments | Finer granularity |
| Min Capital Investment | Higher | Medium | Lower |
| Power Scaling | Linear (high slope) | Linear (medium slope) | Linear (low slope) |
| Cooling Requirements | Highest | High | Moderate |

**Analysis**: AWS Silicon offers more granular scaling with smaller minimum investment, allowing organizations to grow capacity more gradually. This can be advantageous for organizations with varying workload demands or budget constraints.

### C.2 Job Parallelism and Queue Management

#### C.2.1 Queue Management Efficiency at Different Scales

| System Configuration | Max Concurrent Jobs | Job Size Flexibility | Queue Optimization |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1× H100 (p5.48xlarge) | 1-2 large jobs | Limited | Poor (large resource blocks) |
| 3× AWS Silicon systems | 6-10 medium jobs | Good | Good (more granular allocation) |
| 10× H100 systems | 10-20 large jobs | Limited | Moderate (still large blocks) |
| 30× AWS Silicon systems | 60-100 medium jobs | Excellent | Excellent (highly flexible) |

**Analysis**: At larger scales, AWS Silicon's smaller computational units provide significant advantages for workload management. Organizations can process multiple diverse workloads simultaneously with more efficient resource utilization, reducing queue wait times and improving overall throughput for mixed workloads.

#### C.2.2 Workload Diversity Impact

| Scenario | H100 Efficiency | AWS Silicon Efficiency | Advantage |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Homogeneous large jobs | 95% | 90% | H100 (+5%) |
| Mixed job sizes | 75% | 92% | AWS Silicon (+17%) |
| Burst workloads | 60% | 85% | AWS Silicon (+25%) |
| Variable priority jobs | 70% | 90% | AWS Silicon (+20%) |

**Analysis**: For organizations with diverse genomic workloads (WGS, exomes, targeted panels, RNA-Seq), the more granular scaling of AWS Silicon allows better resource utilization. As workload diversity increases, the efficiency advantage of AWS Silicon becomes more pronounced.

### C.3 Scaling with Growing Demand

#### C.3.1 Growth Scenarios: Incremental Investment Required

| Growth Scenario | Initial Daily Capacity | Target Daily Capacity | H100 Investment | AWS Silicon Investment | Difference |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------------|------------|
| Startup Growth | 10 samples | 50 samples | $~400K (full system) | $~150K (partial system) | 62.5% savings |
| Clinical Lab Expansion | 50 samples | 100 samples | $~800K (2 systems) | $~300K (partial systems) | 62.5% savings |
| Population Study | 100 samples | 500 samples | $~3.2M (8 systems) | $~2.4M (18 partial systems) | 25% savings |
| National Project | 500 samples | 2000 samples | $~12.8M (32 systems) | $~10.5M (80 partial systems) | 18% savings |

**Analysis**: The more granular scaling of AWS Silicon enables significant capital expenditure savings during growth phases. This advantage is most pronounced for smaller organizations and early growth stages, where partial system deployments can meet incremental capacity needs without requiring full H100 system investments.# PRISM: Parallel Research Infrastructure for Scientific Multiprocessing
