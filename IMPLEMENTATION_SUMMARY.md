# Graviton Backend Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of AWS Graviton backend support in the Prism framework.

## Overview

The implementation provides comprehensive support for all AWS Graviton processor versions (1, 2, 3, 3E, and 4) with their specific capabilities and optimizations. A clean, intuitive API allows users to easily select specific Graviton versions for their computational workloads.

## Components Implemented

1. **Graviton Device Classes**
   - `GravitonDevice` - Base class for all Graviton processors
   - `Graviton1Device` - AWS Graviton 1 (Cortex-A72, A1 instances)
   - `Graviton2Device` - AWS Graviton 2 (Neoverse N1, C6g/M6g/R6g/T4g instances)
   - `Graviton3Device` - AWS Graviton 3 (Neoverse V1, 256-bit SVE, C7g/M7g/R7g instances)
   - `Graviton3EDevice` - AWS Graviton 3E (Enhanced for networking and HPC with 35% higher vector performance, C7gn/HPC7g instances)
   - `Graviton4Device` - AWS Graviton 4 (512-bit SVE2, FP8 support, C8g/M8g/R8g instances)

2. **Device Context Manager**
   - `DeviceContext` - Context manager for temporarily switching active devices
   - Integration with device switching mechanism

3. **Version-Specific Hardware Features**
   - SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) configuration
   - Vector width optimization (128-bit, 256-bit, 512-bit)
   - Memory alignment optimization
   - HPC workload optimization for Graviton 3E
   - Networking optimization for Graviton 3E
   - Confidential computing for Graviton 4

4. **Framework Integration**
   - Global device management
   - Specialized context managers for each Graviton version
   - Automatic hardware detection
   - Workload-specific device selection

## API Examples

### Using the Context Manager API

```python
import prism as pr

# Using specialized context managers
with pr.graviton3e() as device:
    # Code executed with Graviton 3E as the active device
    if device.is_hpc_optimized():
        device.optimize_for_hpc(hpc_type="mpi")
    result = my_computation(data)

# Using the general device API with version specification
with pr.device("aws.graviton", version=4) as device:
    # Code executed with Graviton 4 as the active device
    result = my_computation(data)
```

### Hardware-Specific Optimizations

```python
import prism as pr

# Graviton 3E optimizations
with pr.graviton3e() as device:
    # Get detailed SVE configuration
    sve_config = device.get_sve_configuration()
    print(f"Vector length: {sve_config['vector_length']} bits")  # 256 bits
    
    # Apply networking optimizations
    if device.is_network_optimized():
        device.optimize_for_networking(network_type="throughput")
        print("Network-optimized mode enabled")

# Graviton 4 optimizations
with pr.graviton4() as device:
    # Use SVE2 with 512-bit vectors
    sve_config = device.get_sve_configuration()
    if sve_config["supports_sve2"]:
        print("Using SVE2 instructions")
    
    # Enable confidential computing
    device.enable_confidential_computing()
```

### Selecting Optimal Device for Workload

```python
import prism as pr

# Create optimal device for HPC workload
device = pr.create_optimal_device(
    workload_type="hpc",
    precision="bf16",
    memory_usage="high"
)  # Will select Graviton 3E on HPC7g instances if available

# Create optimal device for networking workload
device = pr.create_optimal_device(
    workload_type="networking",
    network_intensive=True
)  # Will select Graviton 3E on C7gn instances if available
```

## Architecture Highlights

1. **Version Detection**
   - Instance type-based detection (e.g., c6g → Graviton 2, c7gn → Graviton 3E)
   - CPU hardware-based detection (CPU part ID)
   - Environment variable override for testing

2. **Feature Abstraction**
   - Common interface for all Graviton versions
   - Version-specific capabilities exposed through unified API
   - Specialized optimizations for specific workloads (HPC, networking)

3. **Memory Management**
   - Optimal memory alignment based on vector width
   - Efficient allocation and data movement
   - Common interface with other accelerators

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Vector width optimization
   - Workload-specific tuning
   - SVE/SVE2 capability detection and utilization

## Testing

The implementation includes:
1. Unit tests for all Graviton versions
2. Tests for version-specific features
3. Tests for specialized optimizations
4. Tests for the device context manager

## Future Work

1. Add more specialized optimizations for different workloads
2. Implement automatic kernel tuning for Graviton-specific features
3. Add profile-guided optimization for Graviton workloads
4. Develop domain-specific libraries optimized for each Graviton version
